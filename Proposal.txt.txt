Executive Summary 
-Being a lifelong musician, a major topic of discussion has always been what specifically makes a hit and what makes a “one-hit-wonder”.
 This project will pertain to the commonalities of billboard charting songs in the 80s, 90s, 2000s and 2010s and how these songs have 
 changed over time. I will primarily use Spotify API to find the songs and artists but will use Kaggle hit song datasets and music 
 industry revenue data as secondary sources to inform my search. Assembling my data spanning 40 years will be tedious but it is possible.

Motivation 
-Music has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember. I’ve always been interested in hit songs and the oddity is a 
“one hit wonder”. Finding the Spotify API peaked my interest because of the unique audio features in each song that I’ll be able to 
find for each song that will paint a picture of how these hit songs have changed as well as how the density of these songs have changed 
over the years.

Data Question 
-How have the musical components of  “one hit wonders” changed over time? Has the density per year changed?

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) 
-I plan on creating a dashboard on Tableau to show my findings. I will primarily use interactive graphs in order to most effectively 
present the data. The intended audience are musicians and music fans in general.

Schedule (through <date of demo day>) 
-1. Get the Data (12/5) 
2. Clean & Explore the Data (12/15) 
3. Create Presentation of your Analysis (12/30) 
4. Internal demos (<date of internal demos) 
5. Demo Day!! (<date of demo day>) 

Data Sources 
-Spotify API
Hit Songs Kaggle
Music Industry Revenue.  

Known Issues and Challenges 
-Spotify API will be quite a challenge to use and I will be extracting four decades worth of song information, which will both pose 
threats. Tutorials and diligence should make the process much easier, though.
